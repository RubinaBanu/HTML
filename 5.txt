<!-- we can add other document/video/txt/image from their site in our own website by embedding i frames...but it is not correct,it is like illegal. ie copying others thing and making ours it is called as clickjacking-hijacking another information and misusing it....so if i create a website and none should use my things using iframe means we need to use <sandbox> attribute -->


<!--The sandbox attribute enables an extra set of restrictions for the content in an iframe.

When the sandbox attribute is present, and it will:

    treat the content as being from a unique origin
    block form submission
    block script execution
    disable APIs
    prevent links from targeting other browsing contexts
    prevent content from using plugins (through <embed>, <object>, <applet>, or other)
    prevent the content to navigate its top-level browsing context
    block automatically triggered features (such as automatically playing a video or automatically focusing a form control)

The value of the sandbox attribute can either be just sandbox (then all restrictions are applied), or a space-separated list of pre-defined values that will REMOVE the particular restrictions.
mozilla doesnt allow its content embedded in any other.so it gives sandbox in iframe...if we try to open that link in our website page <video>,it will show errror and make us to go to its website-->

<!-- vector graphics 

images should not pixelate when we zoom them.
two types of images
1.Rastor images 
2.Vector images

Raster images:
Raster images are defined using grid of pixels.
EG: .bmp, .png, .jpg, .gif
Vector images:
SVG[Scalable Vector Graphics] format images(.svg)
it is an xml based language for describing vector images 

raster graphics are composed of pixels, while vector graphics are composed of paths. A raster graphic, such as a gif or jpeg, is an array of pixels of various colors, which together form an image.-->
