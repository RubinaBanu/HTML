<!-- A favicon is a small image displayed next to the page title in the browser tab.You can use any image you like as your favicon. You can also create your own favicon on sites like https://www.favicon.cc    or https://www.favicon-generator.org   ...in this website we can create our own fav icon by uploading the needed images and can make suitable changes like color,size etc-->
<!--Tip: A favicon is a small image, so it should be a simple image with high contrast.-->
<!--To add a favicon to your website, either save your favicon image to the root directory of your webserver, or create a folder in the root directory called images, and save your favicon image in this folder. A common name for a favicon image is "favicon.ico".
Next, add a <link> element to your "index.html" file, after the <title> element, like this
<title>My Page Title</title>
  <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/images/favicon.ico"> -->


<!--The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document.
Only used if the href attribute is present.-->

<!-- The rel attribute can be used on the following elements:
Elements 	Attribute
<a> 	     rel
<area> 	     rel
<link> 	     rel   (icon will come under this link element of rel attribute)
<form> 	     rel              -->

<title>RubinaPage</title>
<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="r.png">
<!-- we can also give like this in href as image name r.png itself instead of changing favicon.ico and give -->
<!--       <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico">.......it can be given like this.the image name should be saved as favicon.ico          -->

<!-- The HTML <video> element is used to show a video on a web page.  
The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume.
It is a good idea to always include width and height attributes. If height and width are not set, the page might flicker while the video loads.
The <source> element allows you to specify alternative video files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.
The text between the <video> and </video> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <video> element. 
To start a video automatically, use the autoplay attribute.
Add muted after autoplay to let your video start playing automatically (but muted)
File Format 	Media Type
MP4 	        video/mp4
WebM 	        video/webm
Ogg 	        video/ogg
The HTML DOM defines methods, properties, and events for the <video> element.
This allows you to load, play, and pause videos, as well as setting duration and volume.
There are also DOM events that can notify you when a video begins to play, is paused, etc. 
Tag 	    Description
<video> 	Defines a video or movie
<source> 	Defines multiple media resources for media elements, such as <video> and <audio>
<track> 	Defines text tracks in media players -->
